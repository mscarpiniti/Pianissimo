# Pianissimo
A U-Net based model for Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) of piano sounds. It presents the implementation of the work introduced in [1].

The proposed model is based on the TensorFlow implementation of the Deep Reservoir Computing introduced by [Claudio Gallicchio](https://github.com/gallicch/DeepRC-TF) in [2].
